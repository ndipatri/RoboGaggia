  Use the Qwiic Scale to read load cells and scales
  By: Nathan Seidle @ SparkFun Electronics

  License: This code is public domain but you buy me a beer if you use this
  and we meet someday (Beerware license).

  The interrupt pin indicates when a sample has been taken. This example shows 
  how the INT pin can be configured active high or active low.

  SparkFun labored with love to create this code. Feel like supporting open
  source? Buy a board from SparkFun!

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic Scale and a RedBoard Qwiic
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
