  Use the Qwiic Scale to read load cells and scales

  and we meet someday (Beerware license).

  The Qwiic Scale is an I2C device that converts analog signals to a 24-bit
  digital signal. This makes it possible to create your own digital scale
  either by hacking an off-the-shelf bathroom scale or by creating your
  own scale using a load cell.

  This example merely outputs the raw data from a load cell. For example, the
  output may be 25776 and change to 43122 when a cup of tea is set on the scale.
  These values are unitless - they are not grams or ounces. Instead, it is a
  linear relationship that must be calculated. Remeber y = mx + b?
  If 25776 is the 'zero' or tare state, and 43122 when I put 15.2oz of tea on the
  scale, then what is a reading of 57683 in oz?

  (43122 - 25776) = 17346/15.2 = 1141.2 per oz
  (57683 - 25776) = 31907/1141.2 = 27.96oz is on the scale

  Hardware Connections:
  Plug a Qwiic cable into the Qwiic Scale and a RedBoard Qwiic
  If you don't have a platform with a Qwiic connection use the SparkFun Qwiic Breadboard Jumper (https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14425)
  Open the serial monitor at 115200 baud to see the output
