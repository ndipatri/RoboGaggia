# roboGaggia - TL;DR

This project is a hardware-hack of the amazing [Gaggia Pro](https://www.wholelattelove.com/products/gaggia-classic-pro-espresso-machine-in-cherry-red?gclid=Cj0KCQjw-fmZBhDtARIsAH6H8qj_Ss3SJIp0CvJAVQRKj4xInX0PIXOTgVx_EXvSSFgazGyuVBLtaYUaAsB3EALw_wcB)

Although it's an amazing machine, the Gaggia requires a number of manual steps to get you from beans to a hot latte:

1. You have to periodically pour water into the top of the Gaggia to refill the water reservoir.  This can be an inconvenience if your Gaggia is under a kitchen cabinet.
2. After you've loaded the portafilter with coffee grounds and put a cup under the group head, you have to wait until the brew heater achieves the correct temperature before you can click the 'brew' button.
3. While brewing, you need to remember the weight of your coffee grounds so you know how much to brew. You need to either weigh your resulting coffee using an external scale or approximate the output by counting the seconds of your extraction.
4. After brewing, you then have to manually switch the 'steam' button and wait for the heater to achieve the steam temperature.
5. After steaming, if you want to brew again, you have to go through the process of extracting water to cool off the heater - the heater is always on with the stock Gaggia, so cooling off the heateater takes a while.

Other things to note about the stock Gaggia Pro:

1. The thermostats which measure the brew and steam temperatures employ a simplistic 'Schmitt Trigger' control algorithm which means the target temperature can vary quite a bit from shot to shot.
2. When brewing, the water pump operates at a fixed rate, so there is no 'pre-infusion' period where the portafilter is filled with low-pressure water before the high pressure water is used to extract the espresso shot.

In an attempt to mitigate the above Gaggia short comings, I've implemented the following features:

1. Integrated scale that fits in the drip tray
2. Dual PID temperature controllers
3. Flow control
4. Auto-Fill water reservoir
5. Microcontroller-based automated brew process that eliminates the need for the Brew or Steam buttons.
6. Cool-down feature to assist in cooling down the heater for brewing.


# Disclaimer

This project involves modifying a perfectly safe commercial espresso machine.  These modifications absolutely make your espresso machine less safe.  It involves both water and electricity.  Please proceed at your own risk.  This is a dangerous modification! If you don't do it right, people will die over a cup of coffee! 

These instructions assume you are proficient in handling both DC and AC electrical components.  If you are not, this is not the project for you, sorry!

Ok, sorry, that's a rather depressing Disclaimer :-(


# Parts List

I will explain in detail how each of these are used. Here is a list of all major components needed for this modification.  I purchased everything either on [SparkFun](Sparkfun.com) or [Amazon](amazon.com).

1. [12 DC Power Supply](https://www.amazon.com/Adapter-SANSUN-AC100-240V-Transformers-Switching/dp/B01AZLA9XQ/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?keywords=12+dc+power+supply&qid=1665095810&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI0LjU4IiwicXNhIjoiNC4wMSIsInFzcCI6IjMuODUifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=12+dv+power+%2Caps%2C153&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEzOEhBV0hCUlNURzZBJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwNzI5MTgxMVQ4UklKQVUzQTVHTCZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNjAxMjAxMUIwTTFQTUVSU0JNViZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) Just buy something like this and smash it with a hammer to get to the fun parts.  You can wire this up to the interal switched-AC power inside the Gaggia.
2. [DC-DC Buck Converter](https://www.amazon.com/HiLetgo-Converter-Circuit-Regulator-Adjustable/dp/B07VJDPZ2L/ref=sr_1_1_sspa?crid=1FEW5SSDSM80M&keywords=dc+dc+buck+converter&qid=1665095735&qu=eyJxc2MiOiI1LjAyIiwicXNhIjoiNC42MCIsInFzcCI6IjQuMjgifQ%3D%3D&sprefix=dc+dc+buck+converte%2Caps%2C104&sr=8-1-spons&psc=1&spLa=ZW5jcnlwdGVkUXVhbGlmaWVyPUEyWTNJSjk3SUcyRDVKJmVuY3J5cHRlZElkPUEwODYxMzIxM1ZMSlROSVg3SjNRRSZlbmNyeXB0ZWRBZElkPUEwNzM0OTMxM1JPS1VWVDM0VTJNSSZ3aWRnZXROYW1lPXNwX2F0ZiZhY3Rpb249Y2xpY2tSZWRpcmVjdCZkb05vdExvZ0NsaWNrPXRydWU=) This is for converting the 12v to a reliable 5v with reasonable power.



  The biggest annoyance is the single-boiler.  You have


## Welcome to your project!

Every new Particle project is composed of 3 important elements that you'll see have been created in your project directory for roboGaggia.

#### ```/src``` folder:  
This is the source folder that contains the firmware files for your project. It should *not* be renamed. 
Anything that is in this folder when you compile your project will be sent to our compile service and compiled into a firmware binary for the Particle device that you have targeted.

If your application contains multiple files, they should all be included in the `src` folder. If your firmware depends on Particle libraries, those dependencies are specified in the `project.properties` file referenced below.

#### ```.ino``` file:
This file is the firmware that will run as the primary application on your Particle device. It contains a `setup()` and `loop()` function, and can be written in Wiring or C/C++. For more information about using the Particle firmware API to create firmware for your Particle device, refer to the [Firmware Reference](https://docs.particle.io/reference/firmware/) section of the Particle documentation.

#### ```project.properties``` file:  
This is the file that specifies the name and version number of the libraries that your project depends on. Dependencies are added automatically to your `project.properties` file when you add a library to a project using the `particle library add` command in the CLI or add a library in the Desktop IDE.

## Adding additional files to your project

#### Projects with multiple sources
If you would like add additional files to your application, they should be added to the `/src` folder. All files in the `/src` folder will be sent to the Particle Cloud to produce a compiled binary.

#### Projects with external libraries
If your project includes a library that has not been registered in the Particle libraries system, you should create a new folder named `/lib/<libraryname>/src` under `/<project dir>` and add the `.h`, `.cpp` & `library.properties` files for your library there. Read the [Firmware Libraries guide](https://docs.particle.io/guide/tools-and-features/libraries/) for more details on how to develop libraries. Note that all contents of the `/lib` folder and subfolders will also be sent to the Cloud for compilation.

## Compiling your project

When you're ready to compile your project, make sure you have the correct Particle device target selected and run `particle compile <platform>` in the CLI or click the Compile button in the Desktop IDE. The following files in your project folder will be sent to the compile service:

- Everything in the `/src` folder, including your `.ino` application file
- The `project.properties` file for your project
- Any libraries stored under `lib/<libraryname>/src`
